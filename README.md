# TikTok Usage and Menstrual Cycle Analysis

## **Project Motivation**

With social media playing a significant role in our daily lives, understanding its usage in the context of biological rhythms 
may provide insights into behavioral tendencies, emotional well-being, and productivity. By investigating how TikTok screentime

and contribute to discussions on digital consumption and personal health.
