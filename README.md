# TikTok Usage and Menstrual Cycle Analysis

## **Project Motivation**
This project aims to explore the relationship between TikTok usage patterns and the phases of the menstrual cycle. 
With social media playing a significant role in our daily lives, understanding its usage in the context of biological rhythms 
may provide insights into behavioral tendencies, emotional well-being, and productivity. By investigating how TikTok screentime 
and content engagement vary across different phases of the menstrual cycle, this project seeks to uncover meaningful patterns 
and contribute to discussions on digital consumption and personal health.

## **Research Questions**

### **Behavioral Analysis**
- Does TikTok screentime vary during different phases of the menstrual cycle?
- Are there differences in the types of content (e.g., entertainment, educational, relaxing) consumed during these phases?

### **Productivity and Focus**
- Does higher screentime coincide with certain days or phases of the cycle, potentially indicating reduced focus or energy levels?

### **Content Recommendation Feedback**
- Does TikTok's algorithm recommend specific types of videos based on implicit behavioral changes during different cycle phases?
- How well do these recommendations align with the user's mood or interests during each phase?

## **Data Description**

### **TikTok Usage Data**
- **Watch History**: timestamps, video categories, and duration of video engagement.
- **Screentime**: daily usage duration.

### **Menstrual Cycle Data**
- **Cycle Phases**: tracked using a menstruation tracking app (e.g., follicular, ovulatory, luteal, menstrual phases).
- **Additional Data** (if available): mood logs, physical symptoms, or energy levels.

### **Content Categorization**
- **Classification** of TikTok videos into content types (e.g., entertainment, educational, relaxing) based on hashtags, captions, or user notes.

## **Expected Outcomes**
This project is expected to:
1. Identify patterns in TikTok screentime and content preferences during specific menstrual phases.
2. Highlight potential correlations between high screentime and perceived productivity or focus levels.
3. Provide insights into how TikTokâ€™s recommendation system aligns with natural behavioral changes during the menstrual cycle.
