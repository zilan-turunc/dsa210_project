# TikTok Usage and Menstrual Cycle Analysis

## Project Motivation
This project investigates the relationship between TikTok usage patterns and the menstrual cycle. With social media playing a significant role in daily life, understanding its use in the context of biological rhythms can provide valuable insights into behavioral tendencies, emotional well-being, and productivity. By analyzing TikTok screentime and content engagement across menstrual cycle phases, this project seeks to uncover meaningful patterns and contribute to discussions on digital consumption and personal health.

## Research Questions
- Does the menstrual cycle affect attention span?  
- How does TikTok screentime vary during different phases of the menstrual cycle?  
- Does increased screentime coincide with cycle phases, potentially indicating reduced focus or energy levels?

## Project Description
This project integrates **TikTok usage data** (watch and login history) with **menstrual cycle tracking data** to identify trends and correlations. By aligning TikTok activity with the phases of the menstrual cycle, I aim to explore behavioral and emotional changes during these phases.

## Data Sources
### TikTok Usage Data:
- **Watch History**: Timestamps and screentime metrics.  
- **Login History**: Daily login times, device usage, and network preferences.  

### Menstrual Cycle Data:
- **Cycle Phases**: Tracked using a menstruation tracking app.  
- **Start and end dates** for each cycle phase.

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned TikTok login and watch data for consistency.  
- Aligned menstrual cycle data with TikTok usage timestamps.  
- Merged cleaned data into collective files.

## Analysis
### Behavioral Patterns:
- Investigated variations in TikTok screentime across menstrual phases.  
- Analyzed attention span and engagement during cycle phases.

### Productivity and Focus:
- Explored correlations between high screentime and focus or energy levels.  
- Identified days or phases with peak usage and potential impacts on productivity.

## Visualization
- **Heatmaps**: Illustrating login frequencies across phases.  
- **Bar Charts**: Comparing screentime between menstrual phases.  
- **Line Graphs**: Showing trends in daily and weekly TikTok engagement.  
- **Scatter Plots**: Highlighting potential correlations between screentime and cycle phases.

## Data Description
### TikTok Usage Data:
- **Watch History**: Includes timestamps of video engagement and duration.  
- **Login History**: Tracks daily login times and device usage.  

### Menstrual Cycle Data:
- **Cycle Phases**: Categorized as menstrual phases using a tracking app.

## Expected Outcomes
This project aims to:
- Identify patterns in TikTok screentime during specific menstrual phases.  
- Highlight correlations between high screentime and productivity or focus levels.  
- Provide insights into how biological rhythms influence social media usage.  
- Contribute to discussions on digital well-being and personal health.

## Conclusion
By integrating TikTok usage patterns with menstrual cycle data, this project highlights behavioral changes and potential impacts of hormonal cycles on digital engagement. These findings can inform future research and practical applications, such as personalized app recommendations or strategies for improving focus and productivity during specific phases.
